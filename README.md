# Inference for hazard ratio under informative censoring using machine learning

## Cox_AIPCW

Cox_AIPCW.R - 
Implements the cross-fitted AIPCW estimator for estimating the marginal log hazard ratio, allows both semi-parametric and data-adaptive machine learning methods (recommended) for the working models. Estimating equation is solved using Newton-Ralphson.


## Simulation

test.R - 
Simulates various settings to compare AIPCW estimators using different working models against extant methods like IPCW and MPLE.
