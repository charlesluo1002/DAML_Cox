# Doubly Robust estimation of Time Average Treatment Effect

## DR-TATE

TATE.R - 
Implements the doubly robust AIPW estimator for TATE, allows both parametric/semi-parametric and non-parametric/machine learning methods for the working models. Estimating equation is solved using Newton-Ralphson.


## Simulation

simulation.R - 
Simulates various settings to compare AIPW estimators with different working models against extant methods like IPW and partial likelihood estimator.
